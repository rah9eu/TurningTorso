***----------------------------***NOTICE***----------------------------***
The grasshopper scripts will both throw an implicit cycle error when run!
This is okay, because what the scripts do is actually delete the input.
This is intentional, as the geometry needs to be aligned on the ground
level, but does not actually belong there. For all warnings/problems that
Grasshopper shows, ignore/skip them. They are intentional and will result
in the output being identical to PostScriptModel.3dm. However, saving the
PreScriptModel.3dm file after running the script will prevent using the
scripts in the future, so please do not actually save the file.
